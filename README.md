# Sky Projector
For the class: 3.3 CDT Increadible machines

A DIY controllable and customizable 3-in-1 sky projector. The code is nothing special, but the technical components, prototyping and planning were interesting. I made a schematic and a 3d model and used components like MOSFETs and PWM Drivers.

With the high power LEDS, I also had to take heat into account in multiple places. Aluminium bases, a fan and even a thick heatsink were needed.
